# Planday FE test
This project demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and Jest to present data from a JSON file in a grid layout. Additionally, it features Pagination and Search functionalities that dynamically modify the data view. Furthermore, I've placed a strong emphasis on  accessibility throughout the development process, ensuring that all users can seamlessly interact with the application.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. Install dependencies
    ```bash 
    npm install

## Usage
1. Start the development server
    ```bash
    npm start

2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Features
- Pagination
    - This feature allows users to navigate through a large dataset by breaking it into smaller, manageable pages
    - Users can click on numbered links or previous/next buttons to move between pages

- Search
    - The search functionality enables users to filter the dataset based on specific criteria, such as keywords or phrases
    - Users can input their search terms into an input field, which dynamically updates the displayed data to match the search criteria
    - If there are no matches, it will display a message for the user to let them know

## Future work
- More unit tests
    - I did not test every edge-case or requirement for this project, so that would be the next steps for this project
